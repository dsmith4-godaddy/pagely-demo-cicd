/*
 * Plugin Name: Totally Cool MU-Plugin
 * Version: 0.42.2
 *
 * This mu-plugin doesn't do anything (obviously). It's here as an example
 * of how you could add an mu-plugin to your repo. The key thing to keep
 * in mind is getting your top-level .gitignore file right - you'll need
 * to ignore /wp-content/mu-plugins/pagely* (to avoid overwriting any of
 * Pagely's own mu-plugins), but otherwise this directory is as safe as
 * any other.
